Do you wish your Vanilla Minecraft creations could move and animate like the ones in mods?
Are you <i>tired</i> of Minecraft's <WigglyText text="silly model limitations?"/> Animated Java is here to help!

<div

Animated Java is a plugin for Blockbench that allows you to create custom animations and models
for Vanilla Minecraft. It uses the power of Java Edition's Data Pack and Resource Pack systems
to bring your creations to life!

- Variants: Swap between different textures in-game.
- Highly optimized: Hours of performance optimizations have gone into Animated Java's Exported Data Pack to make sure it's as fast as possible.
- Limited Molang support. If Blockbench can render it, Animated Java can animate it.
- Text Display previewing and animation support.
- Resource Pack-less exporting. Animate Vanilla block and item models!
- Command Locators: Run commands relative to a locator's position and rotation via the new command keyframes.
- Camera Plugin Support: Install the [Blockbench Camera Plugin](https://www.blockbench.net/plugins/cameras) to create cinematic camera paths with ease!
- Animation Tweening: Create smooth transitions between animations.

And much more!

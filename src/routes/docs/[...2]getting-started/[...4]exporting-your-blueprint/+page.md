{$frontmatter.description}

To export your project, navigate to `Animated Java` > `Export`.

![export-step1](/img/steps/export/1.png)

If you have any issues with your project settings, and you will be prompted to fix them before exporting.

Once the export completes, Switch over to Minecraft and run `/reload` to update the Data Pack, and `f3 + t` to update the Resource Pack.

If you've already summoned any rigs in the world, you will need to re-summon them to see the changes.

That's it! Your rig is now ready to use in Minecraft.

:::admonition type="tip"
If you only change animations, you can reload just the Data Pack with `/reload` to see the changes.

However, if you change the model, [Variants](/docs/the-blueprint-format/variants/), or any Blueprint settings, you will need to reload both the Data Pack and the Resource Pack.

Bones are a default feature from Blockbench, learn more about them [here](https://www.blockbench.net/wiki/guides/bedrock-modeling#bone-structure).

Animated Java adds a few new features to bones, such as the ability to define custom NBT for the bone when it's summoned in-game.

## Bone Config

The bone config can be accessed by right clicking the bone in the outliner and selecting `Open Bone Config`.

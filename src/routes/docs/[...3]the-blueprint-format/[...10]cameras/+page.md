Looking for how to interact with a Camera in-game? Check out [Interacting with Cameras](/docs/rigs/cameras).

## Installing the Camera Plugin

Animated Java does not include camera functionality by default. To add camera functionality to your Data Pack, you will need to install the [Camera Plugin](https://www.blockbench.net/plugins/cameras).

## Creating a Camera

To create a camera, right click the Outliner and select `Add Camera`.

If this button isn't there, you can press `h` and then search for `Add Camera`.

## Animating Cameras

Cameras can be animated by adding keyframes to their position / rotation Timelines just like any other element.
